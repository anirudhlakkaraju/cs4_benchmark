I avoided the public and most human interaction outside of the internet at all costs , yet here I sit in a damn Starbucks on Michigan in Chicago a week before Christmas . She was just so damn insistent on meeting me here , swearing up and down that she needed to talk to me in person and threatened if I did n't show up , she 'd come after me . She 's always had a personality like that , so strong willed and passionate , she was exhausting for people like me to be around . It was n't always that way though , we were practically inseparable since birth , but then we turned fourteen and it 's well known that the intuition reaches max ability during puberty . That would n't be a problem for most , thanks to the discovery of the vaccine . The intuition could be controlled with a simple yearly shot , but there was a small number of people ( one in 5 million ) who would prove to have a genetic mutation that makes the vaccine ineffective . I 'm one of the unlucky few who got the genetic mutation . The scientists are still trying to figure out how to get around that , but it has n't been going well . So I tend to avoid public and people at almost all costs , because I feel everything of everyone around me depending on the intensity of their emotions and how close they are to me . Sigh . Though , I better stop my pity party before Tiffany gets here considering I 'm supposed to be happy to see her . Nothing a pumpkin spice latte ca n't fix , right ? I ca n't even remember the last time I had one was , considering getting one meant going into public . I waited in line and focused on mentally blocking out everyone around me . I counted the amount of letters on the menu board , trying to ignore people . 1 , 2 , 3 ... I suddenly felt very irritated at the girl to the right of me 's boyfriend . He was being such a cheap ass . How could he have not gotten me that purse ? It 's Christmas ! Wait , me ? No , her . Her that purse ... . I 'm clearly out of practice . 34 , 35 , 36 ... Ugh , I felt nausea sweep over me , but this time I could n't tell if it was my nerves or the pregnant woman across the Starbucks looking sickly at the chocolate scone in front of her ... and that was where I lost it . I ran to the bathroom and lost my early dinner into the toilet . I sat there shaking and wiped down my forehead and decided being here was just too much to handle at this time of the year . Tiffany would understand , she 's been my best friend since we were kids , she probably never even considered how busy it 'd be . I got up off the floor and dug my cell out of my purse and shot her a text to tell her it was a bit too much for me to meet right now and we 'd have to meet in a more personal area . When I dropped my phone back in my purse , I then dug out a travel mouthwash and swished it around and spit it out into the toilet and flushed . Okay , okay . Now to get home in one piece and not lose it again . Damn , I need to get better at this . I can not live my whole life locked up in my apartment , becoming some crazy cat lady betting on a new and improved vaccine . I then devised a plan to move as quickly as possible to get home , but when I stepped out of the bathroom , I felt him . I felt him before I even saw him like a warm breeze in spring , like the smell of fresh cut grass , like the amazement you feel when waking up as a kid in the morning to find the world had been transformed to a winter wonderland of white snow overnight . I felt his eyes sweep over my body as if I were the one looking at me . He took in every bit of me , my long brown hair , pale skin , blue eyes , my tiny frame that was drowning in this sweater . He took it all in with appreciation . Under normal circumstances , this would 've creeped me out . I knew I was n't unattractive and I was used to feeling horny men 's emotions while looking at me , but his were so different . He did n't look at me with just hunger , there was something else there . Love . He loved what he saw . The emotions burst inside me , like a blind man seeing the love of his life for the first time . I felt his satisfaction when I locked eyes with him and he saw on my face that I appreciated his beauty . I also felt his sudden realization like a bucket of cold water when it occurred to him by the look on my face that I felt everything he was feeling . That was n't a good thing . People who did n't get their vaccine were considered creeps , perverts who intrude on other 's privacy . It was pretty stupid of society to think that , if you ask me ,\",\n          \"The storm had been raging for two days . There was a red weather warning , as gale-force winds and heavy rain had made the roads too dangerous to drive on . It was perfect for my purposes . Everyone else in the town was inside , most of them probably waiting out the storm by candlelight by now , due to widespread power cuts mentioned on the radio . Nobody I knew would see me , nobody would stop and wonder why I was out for a walk at four in the morning . Nobody could stop me now . I was coming on to the bridge , the high grey concrete beast that spanned a river , swollen from the storm waters . A gust of wind threw me off balance , and I stumbled a few steps closer to the railing . I tore myself away , into the road . Not yet . Not now . I looked up , brushing the mud off my coat . Another figure was approaching from the other side , small and bowed , as they were walking directly into the wind . I kept walking , faster now , struggling to get there without falling , without having to talk to this stranger . They seemed to have the same idea . Running now , I got to the center of the arch , the highest point of the structure . We met in the middle , two figures alone in the storm , lit only by the weak light of the moon . The stranger nodded to me , before reaching for the railing , getting ready to clamber over . `` Wait ... ? '' He turned to me , leaning on his outstretched arm for support . I knew what he looked like now , a young guy , like myself . His face was shaded by his hood , but I saw dark hair , pale skin and a glint from his one visible eye - grey - before he looked back at the edge . `` Why ? '' he whispered with a sigh , his voice croaking a little . `` I do n't know who you are , and I do n't care . You should n't have talked to me . '' I came a little closer . `` You came here to kill yourself ? '' I asked , already knowing the answer `` That 's something we have in common then . Why do you want to do it ? '' I was taken aback at the sudden intensity in his voice . `` I 'm ... I 'm here because I do n't have anything to keep me here . Everything is so , so ... '' I faltered . `` Pointless ? Worthless ? '' he put in with a nod of his head `` I get that . There is n't a finish line , right ? You just keep going , doing your time . But why now ? '' I moved over to the railing , beside the stranger . He was slightly taller than me , I realized . `` Everything got so caught up . There 's so much pressure , there 's so many ways to slip up . '' It had stopped raining , but the wind was still chilling me . `` Why are you here ? '' I heard a little grim chuckle in his voice . `` All these monsters in my head . The thoughts that just wo n't give up . The memories of every bad thing that 's ever happened , replaying on a constant loop . The people . Especially the people . '' `` You 're afraid of what they say about you ? '' He sighed again , his breath snatched away by the wind . `` More what they say behind my back , when they think I ca n't hear . '' He struck a fist on the metal . `` I do n't have time for this . '' He started raising a foot , about to step up . `` Wait ... '' I reached for his shoulder , holding onto him . He froze , and slowly slumped back onto the railing . `` Lonely ? '' he asked . `` Always . My closest friend died a few months back . Car accident . There 's been nobody else . '' `` I 've never talked to somebody like this . Honestly . How did it get this bad ? '' `` The sleepless nights . the panic attacks . Her face . My reflection . '' He glanced at me , and whispered , '' What 's wrong with your reflection ? '' `` My eyes do n't look like mine anymore . They look wrong . '' `` Show me . '' He turned and held my face towards him . `` What are you ... ? '' I stared back into his , seeing the pain , the fear , the sadness ... I pushed him away , breathing short shallow gasps . I could see myself reflected in those eyes . I reached towards the railing . This stranger could n't change anything . I could still go through with this . This time , I 'd finish what I intended to do tonight . And then it came . A short , hesitant `` Wait ... '' `` I stopped . `` If you go , I will go too . My family kicked me out . '' I glanced back at him . The rain had stopped a few minutes ago , but there was water dripping from his face . Tears . `` I 've got nowhere else to go to . '' `` Why were you kicked out ? '' He took a shaky breath . ``\",\n          \"I know I stayed up too late last night because I actually ordered something from one of those stupid infomercials . It made so many outlandish claims , `` NEVER DULLS '' , `` CUTS THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE BUTTER '' , `` UNBREAKABLE METAL '' . I just had to see if it was possible for this to be real . The infomercial said the blade was made of some sort of rare earth metal that had only recently been discovered , but for $ 9.99 how rare could it be ? I was surprised to find a box this morning from the company that manufactured the knife . Had it already arrived ? I figured it would probably ship from some big factory in China , but it had n't even been more than 6 hours since I ordered it and there it was . I brought the box inside and started to open it . As I opened it a piece of paper slipped out . I picked it up and read it in an infomercial voice . `` Congratulations on your brand new mythrium knife . Enjoy cutting anything from butter to the most stale bread with ease . '' At the bottom of the paper there was a short disclaimer that said , `` WARNING- Extremely sharp , keep out of reach of children . Never cut toward yourself . Do not bring into contact with powerful magnets or extreme heat . '' That last part really confused me , but I thought it was just because it was cheap metal . I took the knife out of the box , and it was beautiful , even more so than in the commercial . The handle was heavy steel . I flipped it open with the `` sapphire '' thumb stud , revealing a beautiful , shining black clip point blade . The metal was like nothing I had ever seen before . It was n't painted black or stained , the metal was black as night , like obsidian . I adjusted my grip on the handle and realized just how comfortable it was . Not only did it look professionally made , but it felt like it too . I decided to give it a try on an apple I had lying on the kitchen counter . I hold the knife over the apple in anticipation , half expecting that when I start to cut it it will actually go straight through . I move the knife through , and it hits the cutting board . It cut the apple quickly , but nothing about it seemed all that extraordinary . I kept cutting the apple , and after I finished I ate it . I stood eating and looking down at the knife , and realized that , besides its looks , there was not much special about this knife . `` Oh well , '' I thought to myself . I have work to do anyways , and I knew deep down the knife would n't really be special . After a couple hours in my office , I had nothing else to do and I got thinking about the knife again . I remembered what it said on the disclaimer , `` Do not bring into contact with powerful magnets or extreme heat . '' But I thought to myself , that if the knife is nothing special , then theres no harm in experimenting . I dug around my house for a magnet and finally found one . I ran back to where i left the knife and moved the magnet toward the blade , but found I was unable to . I pushed harder , and was pushed back ever more . I backed up , annoyed , and threw the magnet at the blade . It deflected away and went straight through the wall on the other side of the room . I jumped back in shock at the power of it . I still was n't satisfied with my experiment , so I walked over to the oven , put the knife in , and cranked it to the max temperature . I waited an hour , and walked in to see it glowing . But it was n't glowing orange or red , it was a dark blue . I was so scared I grabbed it out of the oven without thinking , not even realizing it did n't burn my hand . I threw it onto the counter , and watched the glow fade as I slowly realized that touching the hot metal did n't even hurt . I waited for it to completely cool , and picked it up again . It felt different in my hand , as if it was perfectly shaped to my hand . When I took it out of my hand I noticed a mark in the middle of my palm , blue like the glow before in some strange shape like a gear . I felt like I had full control of the knife , and some urge caused me to throw it across the room at a banana . It flew straight where I wanted it to , cutting the banana in half , and before I understood what happened the knife appeared back in my hand . I could n't comprehend what was happening . I closed the knife , threw it onto the couch in the other room , and ran to my bedroom . As I lie on my bed thinking , I realize that in my hand , I keep squeezing down something . The knife has come back to my hand again . I begin to cry as I start to think I must be going insane when I hear my doorbell ring . I wiped the tears away with my sleeve and ran to the door .
